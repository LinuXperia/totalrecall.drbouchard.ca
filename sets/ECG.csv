"The <b>inferior</b> leads consist of which leads?","II, III, and AV<sub>F</sub>"
"The <b>Lateral</b> leads consist of which leads?","I, AV<sub>L</sub>, V5, and V6"
"The <b>anterior</b> leads consist of which leads?","V3 and V4"
"The <b>septal</b> leads consist of which leads?","V1 and V2"
"ST-segment elevation of at least 2mm in any anatomically contiguous leads suggests what?","Injury or infarct"
"ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion may be indicative of what?",Ischaemia
"Reciprocal ST-segment changes can be noted where?","In the leads away from the infarct."
"For a bundle branch block (BBB) to be present, the QRS duration must be greater than ____.",120ms
"What type of medical condition should be suspected if you notice ST-segment elevation in all leads?",Pericarditis
"A normal axis?","-30 to 90 degrees"
"A pathological Left axis deviation?","-30 to -90 degrees"
"A Right axis deviation?","greater than 90 degrees"
"True or False? A 12-Lead ECG can be performed by only using a 3-lead monitor.","True:
By moving the LL(red) lead to all the V-lead (precordial) positions and switching to lead III, you can capture the same views of the myocardium as a 12-Lead ECG."
"Which leads are known as the axial or limb leads?","LA(black), LL(red), RA(white), and RL(green)"
"If axis deviates away from the injured myocardium, then a lateral infarct would most likely yield a ____ axis deviation.","Right axis deviation"
"A pathological 'Q' wave, must be greater than 25% of overall QRS depth, and is usually indicative of what? ","A previous MI"
"A 60-year-old man presents with acute renal failure, and his hyperkalemia. What changes would you expect to see on ECG?","Marked widening on the QRS complex (K+ causes dysfunction in the sodium channels, slowing action potential transmission speed through the muscle).
Peaked T waves (fast repolarization of the ventricles).
When severe, may progress to a sinusoidal pattern and is immediately life threatening."
"How do you calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc)?","QTc = QT / sqrt(RR)
Corrected QT interval is equal to the QT interval divided by the square root of the RR interval immediately preceding the interval you're measuring."
"What is the normal duration of the QT interval (after correcting for heart rate - the QTc interval)?","0.42 seconds,
or slightly more than *2 big squares* on a standard ECG."
"What is indicated by a predominant R wave combined with right axis deviation?","Right ventricular hypertrophy"
"Beyond what angle is considered right axis deviation (RAD)?","90 degrees."
"Beyond what angle is the cardiac axis indicative of left axis deviation?","-30 degrees."
"Describe a left atrial abnormality (LAA) seen on ECG.","A *relatively* tall R wave and inverted T wave in V1."
"To what values is a typical ECG calibrated?","10mm vertical deflection = 1mV, and 1mm of horizontal distance = 0.04s."
"How wide is as normal QRS complex?","120ms, or 3 small squares."
