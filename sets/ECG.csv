The Inferior leads consist of which leads?,"Leads II, III, and AvF."The Lateral leads consist of which leads?,"Leads I, AvL, V5, and V6."The Anterior leads consist of which leads?,Leads V3 and V4.The Septal leads consist of which leads?,Leads V1 and V2.ST-segment elevation of at least 2mm in any anatomically contiguous leads suggests what?,Injury or infarct.ST-segment depression or 'T' wave inversion may be indicative of what?,Ischemia.Which leads are known as the precordial or chest leads?,"V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6."Reciprocal ST-segment changes can be noted where?,In the leads away from the infarct."To perform a rapid Right sided 12-Lead, what precordial lead must be moved to the same location on the Right side?","When moved to the opposite side V4 now becomes V4R, and a rapid Right sided 12-Lead ECG may be performed.""For a bundle branch block (BBB) to be present, the QRS duration must be greater than what?",Any QRS duration greater than 120mm constitutes a BBB.What type of medical condition should be suspected if you notice ST-segment elevation in all leads?,Pericarditis.A normal axis?,0 to 90 degrees. (all up)A physiologic Left axis deviation?,"0 to -30 degrees. (up, up, down)"A pathological Left axis deviation?,"-30 to -90 degrees. (up, down, down)"A Right axis deviation?,"+90 to 180 degrees. (down, up, up)"An extreme Right axis deviation?,-90 to 180 degrees. (all down)True or False?  A 12-Lead ECG can be performed by only using a 3-Lead monitor?,"True, by moving the LL(red) lead to all the V-Lead (precordial) positions and switching to Lead III, you can capture the same views of the myocardium as a 12-Lead ECG!"Which leads are known as the axial or limb leads?,"LA(black), LL(red), RA(white), and RL(green).
Salt(RA), pepper(LA), ketchup(LL), and relish(RL)."The heart consists of these coronary vessels?,"The RCA(right coronary artery) and the LCA(left coronary artery), which then branches into the LAD(left anterior descending artery) and the LCX(left circumflex).""If axis deviates away from the injured myocardium, then a lateral infarct would most likely yield a what type axis deviation?",Right axis deviation."A pathological 'Q' wave, must be greater than 25% of overall QRS depth, is usually indicative of what? ",A previous MI.
